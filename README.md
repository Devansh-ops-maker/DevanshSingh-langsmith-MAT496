## Learnings from Module 1 (Course 1)
- Implemented and explored the **traceable detector**.  
- Learned how traceable helps monitor and debug the steps taken by the application.  
- Observed how it generates logs for each step, making the workflow more transparent and easier to analyze.

---

## Changes Implemented for Module 1(Course 1)
- Added **new prompts** for improved responses.  
- Applied the **traceable detector** to all functions.  
- Added **metadata for functions** to enhance traceability and logging.

## Learnings from Module 1 (Course 2)
We learned about the different types of runs in LangSmith: **LLM**, **tool**, and **retrieve**.  

- **LLM run:** Executes a language model to generate responses.  
- **Tool run:** Calls a predefined function or tool to perform a task.  
- **Retrieve run:** Fetches relevant documents or data for answering questions.  

**Changes done in Module 1 (Course 2):**  
- Added three functions that retrieve `.cpp` and `.txt` files to demonstrate the retrieve run (hardcoded for demo).  
- Added a tool checker function to return the name of the admin if asked.  
- Added prompts for the LLM run.
