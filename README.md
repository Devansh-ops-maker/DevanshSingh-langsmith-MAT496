## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the **traceable detector** in a Python application. The traceable detector allows us to trace the steps taken by the application, creating logs for every function call and action performed.

---

## Learnings from Module 1 (Course 1)
- Implemented and explored the **traceable detector**.  
- Learned how traceable helps monitor and debug the steps taken by the application.  
- Observed how it generates logs for each step, making the workflow more transparent and easier to analyze.

---

## Changes Implemented for Module 1(Course 1)
- Added **new prompts** for improved responses.  
- Applied the **traceable detector** to all functions.  
- Added **metadata for functions** to enhance traceability and logging.
